This folder contains the code for the submission. The contents of this folder should be:
- annotations-color.zip : 8 combined color annotation maps
- annotations-folder.zip : 8 individual annotations folders for each fundus image
- images.zip : 8 fundus images
- Predictions.ipynb : This file contains the code to be run.

The Predictions.ipynb file is where all the code for this demonstration resides, the zip files are the associated data that is required. Within this file you will be able to observe the qualitative and quantative perfomance of two selected models.

All instructions on running the Predictions.ipynb file are included within. The preliminary instruction is that it is highly recommended to run the file in google colaboratory with the GPU accelerator enabled. When using google colaboratory, it must be ensured that the 3 zip files are uploaded in the file section.

Two trained models with different architectures are utilized for this demonstration, the number of models is limited to two as the size of each model is quite large. The models can be downloaded from within the jupyter notebook without any intervention.

After navigating to google colab, click the upload file section and upload Predictions.ipynb.
